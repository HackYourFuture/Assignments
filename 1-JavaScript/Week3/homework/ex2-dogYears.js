You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Let's
calculate it!

1. Complete the function named `calculateDogAge`.

  - It takes one parameter: your (fictional) puppy's age (number).
  - Calculate your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to
    7 dog years.
  - Return a string: "Your doggie is `age` years old in dog years!"

2. Use `console.log` to display the result of the function for three different
   ages.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

function calculateDogAge(age /* TODO parameter(s) go here */) {
  // TODO complete this function
  return age * 7;
}

function main() {
  console.log("Your doggie is " + calculateDogAge(1) + " years old in dog years!"); // -> "Your doggie is 7 years old in dog years!"
  console.log("Your doggie is " + calculateDogAge(2) + " years old in dog years!"); // -> "Your doggie is 14 years old in dog years!"
  console.log("Your doggie is " + calculateDogAge(3) + " years old in dog years!"); // -> "Your doggie is 21 years old in dog years!"
}

// ! Do not change or remove the code below
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'test') {
  main();
}
module.exports = calculateDogAge;
