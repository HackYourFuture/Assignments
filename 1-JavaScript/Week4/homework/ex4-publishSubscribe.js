A software pattern that you may encounter in the future is a construct called
the Observer Pattern. It enables "listeners" (which are usually functions) to
"subscribe" to "notifications" from a "publisher". Any number of listeners can
subscribe.

Look at the code below:

- The call to the `createPublisher` function returns an object. For ease of
  reference, let's call it a "Publisher" object here. The Publisher object has
  two properties, `subscribe` and `notify`, which are both functions. In this
  exercise you are required to complete them. (But continue reading first.)

- As you can see below, the `createPublisher` function is called and the
  resulting Publisher object is assigned to the `myPublisher` variable.

- Next, two "listener" functions are defined, notably `consoleUpperCase` and
  `consoleLowerCase`. A listener function is defined here as a function that
  takes a single parameter, `message`. It is up to the listener what to do
  with `message`. (The Publisher has no say in this!).

- The "listener" functions are added as "subscribers" to `myPublisher` by
  calling its `subscribe` function. The `subscribe` function should take the
  function passed to it as an argument and push it onto the `listeners` array.
  (Yes, you can store functions in an array. Functions are treated in JavaScript
  like any other value.

- The standard `console.log` function, which also conforms to the minimum
  requirement for a "listener" (although it can take more than one argument)
  is also added as a subscriber.

- Finally, a call to the Publisher's `notify` function is expected to iterate
  through, and call, all subscribers from the `listeners` array, passing on the
  notification message to each listener.

Good luck with completing `createPublisher`!

      listeners.forEach((listen) => listen(notification));
    },
  };
}

function consoleUpperCase(message) {
  console.log(message.toUpperCase());

function consoleLowerCase(message) {
  console.log(message.toLowerCase());

myPublisher.subscribe(consoleUpperCase);
myPublisher.subscribe(consoleLowerCase);

// "LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS HERE!"
// "let's see what happens here!"

  console.log(message.split(' ').reverse().join(' '));
